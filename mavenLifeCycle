Two simple rules work for me for groupId and artifactId:

1. reverse-domain-packages for groupId (since such are quite unique) with all the constrains regarding Java packages names
2. project name as artifactId (keeping in mind that it should be jar-name friendly i.e. not contain characters that
maybe invalid for a file name or just look weird)

groupId : com.companyname.project
artifactId : project
version : 0.0.1

validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile - compile the source code of the project
test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
