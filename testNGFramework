What is a Test Framework: A set of rules and guidelines which are helpful in test script creation and designing.
It can also be considered a set of good practices and tools that helped testing persons to write and test functionalities
more efficiently. It can be comprised of test-data handling methods and the results storing process. 
Additionally, the set rules are not also mandatory to be followed, A QA professional can still use some of these
rules and some of his own as per requirement. 

What is TestNG Framework: This framework is inspired by JUnit and NUnit  and has many additional newer functionalities
such as annotations and can enable a  script writer to run his code in a big thread-pool.
Also can be called as a hybrid architecture because its a combination of two frameworks which are 
Data-driven and Method-driver framework, Additionally the execution is controlled by its internal suite files which are comprised of  
TestNG classes.
 
Expanation of some terminologies can be given as :
Suite: Suite in testNG is maintained and represented by a XML file, Also it is defined as <suite>
Test : This can contains one or more classes which are to be executed and is defined as <test> in  a suite
TestNG Class: Mandatory to contain atleast one of the Naaotations of testNG and contains methods to be executed , it is defined as <class>
Test Method: @Test denotes the method which has a actual execution code
 
Also Steps of execution: First of all @BeforeMethod is executed for every @Test in the class, after this all the test methods(@Test) will 
start executing and at the end @aftermethod gets executed after every @Test method execution
 
@BeforeMethod contains preconditions: which are like opening browser, navigation to desired URL and other navigational steps,
@Test contains business logic or the actual test case or it can be said as they contains transactional steps
@AfterMethod contains storing or recording of result data and closing of browser etc...
